# PupPace: Your Smart Walk & Run Companion

PupPace is a web app I built for dog owners that makes your daily walks way more fun. It checks the weather and your dog's breed to suggest the best times to go out, and then acts as your walking buddy with music that changes based on your pace.

Just start a walk, pick your speed, and PupPace creates a Spotify playlist that keeps up with you.
